**Brick Breaker Game Project**
-----

**Overview**

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game developed for an **FPGA platform**. This project involved designing and implementing the game using** C programming** and **hardware-specific memory access** techniques. The game features **dynamic graphics**, interactive gameplay, and a responsive **user interface**, providing an immersive experience on custom hardware.

**Code Implementation**

The game is implemented in C, utilizing **direct memory access** for graphical updates and input handling. Key functions include drawing pixels and shapes, handling push button inputs, and managing game states (start, gameplay, and game over). The logic for **ball movement**, collision detection, and lives left are displayed on **7-Segment Display** is carefully crafted to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

**Technical Skills**

- **C Programming:** Proficient in writing and optimizing C code for hardware interaction and game logic implementation.
- **Memory-Mapped I/O:** Experienced in using direct memory access for real-time graphics and **input handling**.
- **FPGA Development:** Knowledgeable in FPGA architecture and utilizing **FPGA capabilities** for custom game development.
- **Problem-Solving:** Demonstrated strong analytical skills in designing efficient algorithms for game mechanics and collision detection.
